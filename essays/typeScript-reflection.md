## First Impressions of TypeScript
I think TypeScript is a very useful language, because of the native browser languages only being HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And because JavaScript is a loosly typed language, there being no types make it hard to read. For instance, if I was coding in a group of 100 people if functions and variables had no types I would have to find the person who wrote it out of the 100 people, ask them what it returns. If this was someone in the same office would not be that bad. However if it was someone in a different country, breath taking.

## TypeScript vs. Other Programming Languages
Last semester I was interning at a Japanese, doing some web developing. Before that I only knew the three HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So I hated traversing through all the files. However, frame works like Node.js offer .tsx files and not having to switch from HTML file to JavaScript
file was pretty awesome. 

## Learning New Concepts (ES6 Features)
I think the call back functions pared with some thing like a react hook is very confusing and hard to figure out.
In most cases there will be Promises, to fetch data and responses so learning to work with asynchronous JavaScript becomes crucial, especially when dealing with APIs, databases, or any time-consuming operations.


## Software Engineering Perspective
Like I said above, I think types are something that makes communication through code easier. And I heard a ccording to industry studies, TypeScript can catch up to 15% of bugs at compile time that would otherwise make it to production in JavaScript projects. This early error detection saves countless hours of debugging and reduces the likelihood of runtime crashes that could affect users. 

## Athletic Software Engineering Experience
I am writing this on the 3th of September, So just took the WOD today. And I think it was great, but I suspect that the main point of the WOD is to not getting better at coding it is more to get better at understanding the problem and coming up with solutions or find ways to tackle with it faster and precise.
A few days ago I was looking at a thing called "AtCoder". It is like a competivive programing contest, and it looks at not only the solution but also at the runtime. So maybe I will try it out.

## Personal Learning Style Assessment
I think the WOD will improve my skills to think and come up with solutions fast. However, I think there are no better ways than coding more and reading the documentation. And some of my weak points is that, especially when it comes to Math.** I just turn off. This is probably beacause I have not use them a lot and simply not familliar with it.

## Looking Forward
Lastly, I think TypeScript is a beautiful language, good for large sized developping and used in many tech giants. So I am looking forward to learning more indepth libraries, and things like React Hooks and other frame works.
